This module implements the backend part of the HGW. 

In order to enable security at both client and server sevels, with the backend acting as a server, you will need to run this 
application with Django, gunicorn and nginx. 

Prerequirements: 

1) Django;
2) gunicorn;
3) nginx; 

The file nginx/hgw_backend.default provides an example file for the configuration of the hgw backend application for nginx; update it
according to your local and gunicorn settings, and then copy it into the sites-available nginx directory, then symlink it also to the 
nginx sites-enabled directory. 
Notice that this file provides the SSL configuration, incunding both server certificates and the location of the CA certificate which 
will be used to sign every client certificate that will be needed to enable clients connections.
